# Femto Shell
## Description:
### A simulation for the bash shell. Currently the shell is able to execute exit command and prints the other commands as they are.
## Features:
### 1- You can choose between two formats of shell: Formal one (Which is similar to the real one: shows the current path and waits for the command), and Informal one (Where the path is replaced with jokes that are selected randomly)
### 2- Executes the exit command (recognized among trailing and end spaces)
### 3- Prints the other commands as they are (will be implemented soon)
## Files:
### 1- femto_shell.c : contains the implementation of the shell
### 2- femto_Shell.h : contains all function prototypes and needed definitions for types and magic numbers
## How to run:
### 1- Download the repository
### 2- Open the terminal in the repo directory
### 3- execute the command (gcc femto_shell.c -o <name.exe>) where name.exe is the executable file name which is of your choice
### 4- Run the executable using the following command: ./<name.exe>
